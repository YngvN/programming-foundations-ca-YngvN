I've placed this in my JS:

- Guitars (Array, Function), info about different guitars, displays with a function
- Brand-name(String), name of the guitar
- Material (String), what material it's available in
- Tuning (String), suggested tunings
- Cutaway (Boolean), whether the guitar has a cutaway or not. Boolean value is changed in an if statement.
- Price (Number), price of the guitar
